			<li>Trebek died Nov. 8 at age 80 but had pre-taped several weeks of shows that have continued to air. He kept working for nearly two years after his diagnosis with pancreatic cancer, remaining in place at the podium where he had become an institution since starting in 1984.</li>
			<li>The show will continue next week with a series of interim hosts, starting with veteran Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings.</li>
			<li>The week's final Trebek episodes began Monday with the host urging viewers to give to others who were suffering during the coronavirus pandemic.</li>
			<li>"We're trying to build a gentler, kinder society, and if we all pitch in just a little bit, we're going to get there," Trebek said.</li>fwf
			<li>His finadl shows were originally scheduled to air Christmas week, but they were put off until this week to give the send-off more exposure.</li>
			<li>In one of the last of the more than 500,000 clues Trebek delivered to contestants in his more than 8,200 episodes, he said: "Basically, this heartwarming Frank Capra classic is about a disgraced financier having an incredibly rough Christmas Eve."</li>
